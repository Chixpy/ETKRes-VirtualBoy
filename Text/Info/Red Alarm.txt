You are mankind's last hope. An angry computer system known as KAOS is bent on destroying all of humanity and has released its robotic armies onto our world. The only weapon left to fight KAOS is a Tech-Wing Fighter, a small spacecraft with a deadly arsenal at its disposal. Your mission is to infiltrate KAOS from within -- destroying any and all resistance in the process.Red Alarm is a 3D shooter in every sense of the word. Travel freely through space avoiding weapon systems and enemy fighters while making your way toward the ultimate showdown with KAOS. At the end of each stage, you will encounter a boss character; once cleared, you are free to watch replays of your actions from multiple camera angles. The Tech-Wing Fighter is equipped with standard shields, homing missiles and a rapid-fire cannon.Four power-up items are dispersed throughout the levels, allowing you to upgrade your basic weapons and shields as well as adding boosters and bonus points to your score. If you are unhappy with the default view of behind the ship, you can also choose a tight view (bringing you closer behind the craft), cockpit view or a three-quarter top view. Suit up soldier, KAOS awaits!
