Halloween is a special time for the Jack Brothers. It is the one day of the year when they can leave their fairy land and cross over to the realm of the humans. This time, however, they've stayed far too long. It's now a race against time to return home or they're lost forever! Choose from Jack O' Lantern, Jack Frost or Jack Skelton and journey through six multi-floored stages before the clock runs out. Each floor is a maze filled with creatures and keys, where taking damage means losing precious time. Luckily, each brother has a weapon and special attack to battle both the enemies and boss characters. A pixie will also help explain each level in detail!
