Take the gameplay of the classic Mario Bros., imagine a 3D twist and you'll probably end up with Nintendo's Mario Clash for the Virtual Boy. The Clash House tower is filled with little critters walking through pipes and along narrow ledges, so it's up to Mario to knock them off using Koopa (or turtle) shells.The twist is that the critters are moving in both the foreground and background, giving each level a 3D appearance. Defeat all of the enemies on a level and you'll move to the next, eventually making your way through 40 floors to the top of the tower. Of course, gameplay will become faster and you'll encounter more challenging enemies the higher you climb. No one said being a plumber was easy!
