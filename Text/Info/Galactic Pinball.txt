The world needs your pinball skills in the battle to save the galaxy from an alien threat. The following four themed pinball tables await you, each rendered in 3D atop a space backdrop: Cosmic, Colony, UFO, and Alien. Points are not your only goal in this game. Aim your ball down certain ramps or hit specific bumpers and you'll confront asteroids, aliens, space pirates, and even an evil skeleton. If you're good enough, you'll be able to access bonus stages that will rocket your score to new heights. Your best performances on each table are automatically saved to battery. Can you unlock the secrets of the galaxy and save the world?
