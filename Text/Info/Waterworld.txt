In Waterworld, you play the Mariner, and are given control of a large skiff armed to the teeth with machine guns. It turns out that the vile character played by Dennis Hopper in the movie has ravaged a series of floating towns, and left their inhabitants to drown. It's up to you to rescue these poor souls, fend off the attacking aqua-goons on jetskis, watch out for sharks, and groove to a new-age soundtrack in the 3D red-and-black environment that only Virtual Boy can deliver.
