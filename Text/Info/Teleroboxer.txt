It is the 22nd century and boxing, as we know it, no longer exists. Technology has advanced to the point where remote controlled robots have replaced human fighters in countries all over the world. These Teleroboxers, as they are called, have recently organized to compete in a tournament to end all tournaments. Which fighter is skilled enough to be called the world champion? Nintendo's Teleroboxer lets you step into the ring controlling your alter-ego Harry the Robot as you vie for the championship. Use jabs, uppercuts, body blows, or the special 
machine-gun
attack"
to
knock
out
your
foes.
Defend
yourself
from
punches
by
guarding
dodging
or
ducking
to
avoid
damage
to
your
strength
meter.
Each
fight
lasts
up
to
five
rounds
and
after
each
bout
your
progress
is
automatically
saved
along
with
your
overall
record.
Should
you
defeat
all
eight
opponents
in
the
tournament
you
will
become
champion
but
wait
--
it's
not
over!
You
still
have
to
face
random
opponents
who
will
try
to
take
it
all
away
from
you.
If
you
lose
your
champion
will
be
permanently
retired
and
you'll
start
once
again
at
the
bottom."
