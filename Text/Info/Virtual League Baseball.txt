The first (and only) American baseball release for the Virtual Boy brings together 18 teams from around the world to compete in one 3D ballpark. Kemco's Virtual League Baseball uses the Virtual Boy's unique perspective to make it seem like every pitch is coming at you. The game offers three different modes of play, including a Single Game, All-Star Game and Pennant Race.The pitching and batting interface is strictly arcade-style, meaning you steer each pitch and time your swing as the ball approaches the plate. While substitutions are allowed for both batters and pitchers, the game does not save any lineup changes or statistics. Virtual League Baseball is also missing both Major League Baseball and MLBPA licenses that would have allowed for real players and team names.
