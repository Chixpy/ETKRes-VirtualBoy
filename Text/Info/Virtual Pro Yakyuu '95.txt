Kemco's Virtual Professional Baseball 95 offers eighteen professional Japanese baseball teams along with actual player statistics based on the 1994 season. Other than the differences in teams (there are no pro teams in the U.S. version), the game is essentially the same game as Virtual League Baseball with one other notable exception: the players resemble chipmunks! While the game features only one stadium, if you are looking to play as the Yakult Swallows, Yokohama BayStars or Seibu Lions, and don't mind non-human players, this could be your field of dreams.
