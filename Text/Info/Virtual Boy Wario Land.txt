Someone has been hoarding treasure deep within the caverns below the Aldegara waterfall, and Wario wants in on the action! In this 3D side-scrolling adventure, play as Wario gathering hearts, coins and mysterious artifacts -- all while defeating various baddies trying to stop you. In order to progress to the next level, you must first locate a key and then board an elevator moving you one step closer to the finish. Travel in between the foreground and background, underwater and through woods to locate the one hidden treasure piece on each stage. During the journey you'll face several boss characters, so it's a good idea to practice your moves. Along with the standard running and jumping, Wario will be able to swim, body slam, toss, stomp and barge into enemies. There are also four power-ups somewhere in the caverns, transforming you into Bull Wario, King Dragon Wario, Sea Dragon Wario and Eagle Wario. If that isn't enough, play several mini-games to get more lives, time or coins as you make your way up from the underground. Don't forget to save your progress and treasure totals in between levels... Happy hunting!
