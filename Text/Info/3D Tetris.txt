Alexey Pajitnov's classic puzzle game of falling blocks has a completely new perspective with 3D Tetris on Virtual Boy. The playing field is now in 3D, defined by wireframe graphics in the middle of the screen. Your goal is to manipulate a series of 3D blocks into a cube-shaped well to form solid layers. Clear ten layers to advance to the next level. Three play options include 3D Tetris, Center-Fill, and Puzzle. The latter involves creating specific shapes or patterns with the blocks to follow a picture displayed within the well. Battery-backed memory lets you save high scores for each game type.
