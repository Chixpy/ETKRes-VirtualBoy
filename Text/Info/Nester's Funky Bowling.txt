Nester's Funky Bowling is not like your ordinary bowling game -- it's in 3D. Choose either Nester or his twin sister Hester and go for the perfect game! First type in your name, choose your bowler's handedness and then set the weight of the ball. The three game modes include Regular Bowling, Practice (where you can set up pins to work on converting difficult spares) and Challenge. Challenge mode lets you try your skill at a number of computer-generated shots. Remember, it's not just bowling...it's funky bowling. Nester and Hester will offer several comical expressions to entertain you. Light-hearted bowling fans take note: this game could be right up your alley.
