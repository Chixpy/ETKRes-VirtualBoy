Mario's Tennis places you on a three-dimensional tennis court against one of seven characters from Mario's past games: Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool, Yoshi, Toad, Koopa or Donkey Kong Jr. All have individual ratings in speed, power and racquet contact area, so find a character that best suits your playing style and select a game of singles or doubles play. Don't worry, you won't have to control both characters; the computer will take over as your partner. Players can also select the difficulty level, length of match, or enter a tournament to play a series of singles or doubles matches until victorious. Tennis features such as hitting ground strokes, lobs, volleys and smashes are all incorporated in the game as are the official rules. Players can also check their statistics after each match, such as total aces served, double faults, errors, net points, baseline points and first serve percentage. Lakitu will be your Chair Umpire and keeps score for all of the matches, but don't think about arguing over line calls -- it's not allowed!
