Join Hudson Soft's famous hero as you search the mysterious island of Ever-Mist for the lost Golden Statue of Bomberman. According to legend, you must first acquire three celestial medals of power in order to unlock the gates securing the statue. Needless to say, these medals are well guarded by some strange characters! In Panic-Bomber, you must defeat these villains who stand in the way of your quest. To do this, you will have to beat them at their own puzzle game -- one in which you must line up falling blocks next to those with similar patterns. Match any three together and they disappear from the screen. A Bomberman game wouldn't be complete without a variety of bombs to wreak havoc with, so count on some explosive and frantic action. Bombs away!
