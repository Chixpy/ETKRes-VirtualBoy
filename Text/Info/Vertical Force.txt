Pilot the star fighter Ragnarok in this top-down shooter from the makers of the Star Soldier series. The action takes place on a vertical-scrolling backdrop, as you battle an armada of flying ships controlled by a rogue computer system. Instead of shooting enemies on one plane, you can switch altitude at any point to take on rivals above or below your ship. In your mission to save the galaxy, you can also call on the help of various AI drones. Flying over a drone automatically activates its offensive support, and up to three drones can be stored in a reserve stockpile. Enhance your ship's laser, wide shot, and shield capabilities by collecting three levels of power-ups. Advance through a total of five stages to save the planet and win the game.
